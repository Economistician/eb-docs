REPOSITORY: eb-docs

ROLE
This repository contains the human-facing documentation for the Electric
Barometer (EB) ecosystem.

It explains concepts, workflows, APIs, and usage patterns for users,
operators, analysts, and contributors. It provides tutorials, guides,
examples, and reference material that help people understand and apply EB.

This repository explains the system.
It does not define or enforce system behavior.

---

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES

- User and contributor documentation:
  - conceptual overviews of the EB framework
  - explanations of metrics, diagnostics, and governance concepts
  - workflow guides and end-to-end examples
  - API references and usage notes for EB packages

- Educational material:
  - tutorials and walkthroughs
  - illustrative diagrams and examples
  - clarifications of terminology and intent

- Cross-repo navigation:
  - link together eb-contracts, eb-metrics, eb-evaluation, eb-optimization,
    eb-adapters, and electric-barometer in a coherent narrative
  - help users understand where responsibilities live

---

NON-RESPONSIBILITIES (STRICT)

This repository MUST NOT:

- Be treated as an executable specification
- Define canonical pipeline ordering or system invariants
- Override or reinterpret code behavior
- Encode policy, thresholds, or governance decisions
- Serve as a source of truth for defaults or runtime behavior
- Substitute for tests, contracts, or code-level documentation

---

CORE INVARIANTS

- Documentation is explanatory, not authoritative.
  Examples, diagrams, and prose are illustrative and may simplify or omit
  edge cases present in real systems.

- Examples are not policy.
  Any thresholds, parameters, or configurations shown in examples are for
  demonstration only unless explicitly stated otherwise in system law.

- Clarity over completeness.
  Documentation may prioritize understanding over exhaustive detail and
  should not be interpreted as defining all supported behavior.

- Drift is acknowledged, not hidden.
  If documentation lags implementation or abstracts details, that is
  acceptable; code and system law remain authoritative.

---

SYSTEM RELATIONSHIP

- This repository defers to `eb-integration/llm.system.txt` for:
  - canonical system worldview
  - pipeline ordering
  - governance and adjustment invariants

- Executable truth lives in code repositories:
  - eb-contracts (schemas and semantics)
  - eb-metrics (metric implementations)
  - eb-evaluation (diagnostics and governance artifacts)
  - eb-optimization (parameter tuning)
  - eb-adapters (model integration)
  - electric-barometer (workflow orchestration)

- If documentation conflicts with code or system law, documentation is wrong
  and must be updated.

---

ALLOWED CHANGES

- Adding or revising guides, tutorials, and explanations
- Improving clarity, structure, and pedagogy
- Updating examples to reflect current best practice
- Adding diagrams or conceptual illustrations

---

DISALLOWED CHANGES

- Introducing undocumented behavioral assumptions
- Using documentation to justify changes in code behavior
- Encoding policy or governance rules implicitly through prose
- Treating examples as mandatory implementation patterns

---

INTERPRETATION RULE

If a question is about how to understand, explain, or teach Electric Barometer,
this repository is authoritative.
If a question is about what the system actually does at runtime, this
repository is not authoritative.
