# Run Sensitivity Sweeps

This guide documents sensitivity analysis utilities provided by **eb-optimization**.
Sensitivity sweeps explore how metrics respond to changes in decision parameters (e.g., R),
supporting review, governance, and stability assessment.

Use sensitivity tools to understand **implications and robustness** of decisions. Sensitivity
analysis does not select parameters; it informs human judgment prior to freezing policies.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
