# Use Policies in eb-evaluation

This guide documents the **policy artifacts** provided by **eb-optimization** that are intended
to be applied during evaluation workflows (typically in `eb-evaluation`).

Policies make decision parameters explicit, immutable, and auditable. Use them to apply RAL
adjustments, τ service thresholds, and cost ratio (R) asymmetry consistently across runs and
environments.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
