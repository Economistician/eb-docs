# Testing and Continuous Integration

This page documents the testing philosophy and continuous integration expectations for
**eb-optimization**. Tests and CI gates enforce behavioral guarantees such as determinism,
policy immutability, and stable public APIs.

These utilities and helpers support local validation and ecosystem-level quality gates
used across Electric Barometer repositories.
