# Contributing

This page documents contribution standards and development expectations for
**eb-optimization**, the decision-optimization layer of the Electric Barometer ecosystem.

Contributions should preserve determinism, layering boundaries, and governance guarantees.
Public APIs, policy semantics, and tuning behavior are treated as long-lived contracts and
must be changed deliberately.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
source code.
