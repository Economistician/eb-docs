# API Overview

This section documents the public API surface of **eb-optimization**, the decision
optimization layer of the Electric Barometer ecosystem.

The API is intentionally narrow and explicit, exposing tuning routines, policy artifacts,
and deterministic search utilities used to calibrate and apply decision parameters in
evaluation workflows.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
source code.
