# Quickstart

This page provides a starting point for using **eb-optimization** to estimate decision
parameters and freeze them into governed policy artifacts for repeatable evaluation.

The typical workflow is:

1. Provide actuals and forecasts
2. Estimate decision parameters (R, τ, RAL)
3. Freeze into policies
4. Apply policies downstream (often in `eb-evaluation`)

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
source code.
