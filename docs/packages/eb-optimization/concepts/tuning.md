# Tuning

This section documents the **tuning philosophy and utilities** provided by eb-optimization
for calibrating decision parameters from historical data.

Tuning in eb-optimization is deterministic, offline, and governance-aware. It exists to
formalize judgment, not to optimize evaluation metrics directly.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
