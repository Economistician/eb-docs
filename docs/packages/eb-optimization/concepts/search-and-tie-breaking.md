# Search and Tie-Breaking

This section documents deterministic **search and tie-breaking utilities** provided by
eb-optimization.

These utilities ensure that parameter selection from candidate sets is reproducible,
explicit, and independent of iteration order or numerical accident.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
