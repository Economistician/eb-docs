# Artifacts and Governance

This section documents how **eb-optimization** represents decisions as explicit, immutable
artifacts and how those artifacts participate in governance workflows.

Artifacts provide traceability, reproducibility, and reviewability for decision parameters
such as cost ratios, service thresholds, and readiness adjustments.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
