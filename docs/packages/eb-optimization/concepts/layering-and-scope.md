# Layering and Scope

This section documents the architectural layering and scope boundaries enforced by
**eb-optimization** within the Electric Barometer ecosystem.

These concepts define where decision calibration ends, where evaluation begins, and how
optimization logic is intentionally constrained to preserve determinism, governance, and
auditability across the stack.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
