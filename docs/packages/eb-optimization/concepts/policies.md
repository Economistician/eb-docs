# Policies

This section documents **policy artifacts** in eb-optimization, which encapsulate decision
parameters (e.g., R, τ, RAL) as governed, reusable objects.

Policies separate estimation from application, ensuring that evaluation behavior is
deterministic, auditable, and consistent across environments and time.

All content below is generated automatically from **NumPy-style docstrings** in the
source code.
