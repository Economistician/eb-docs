# Changelog

This changelog documents **semantic and contractual changes** to eb-contracts.

Version numbers are treated as **semantic promises**, not release metadata.

---

## How to read this changelog

- **Added** — backward-compatible additions
- **Changed** — semantic or behavioral changes
- **Deprecated** — supported but discouraged
- **Removed** — breaking changes (new major version)

---

## Contract stability guarantee

Once a contract version is released:

- Column meaning does not change
- Semantics remain stable
- Historical artifacts remain interpretable

Breaking changes always require a new major version.
