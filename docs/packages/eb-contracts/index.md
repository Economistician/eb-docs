# eb-contracts

Canonical data contracts for the **Electric Barometer (EB)** ecosystem.

This repository defines the **semantic boundaries** that govern how forecasts,
costs, results, and context are represented, validated, and exchanged across
all EB systems.

Contracts turn assumptions into enforceable guarantees.

## How to use this documentation

This documentation is organized into four layers:

- **Getting Started** — how to install and validate your first artifact
- **Concepts** — the governing philosophy and rules behind EB contracts
- **Guides** — how contracts are used in real workflows
- **API Reference** — the authoritative, code-backed interface

If it didn’t pass through `eb_contracts.validate`, it isn’t an EB artifact.
