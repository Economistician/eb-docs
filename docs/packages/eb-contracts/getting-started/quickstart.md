# Validation Modes

Validation modes control **how strictly contracts are enforced** at runtime.

They do not change what contracts mean.

---

## Supported modes

- `strict` — fail fast (default)
- `warn` — emit warnings
- `off` — bypass enforcement (use sparingly)

---

## Governance note

Validation modes are enforcement controls, not semantic switches.
