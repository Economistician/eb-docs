# Papers

The Papers section provides access to the formal research and technical foundations of the Electric Barometer framework. These documents establish the mathematical, theoretical, and governance principles that underpin the concepts, metrics, and optimization workflows described elsewhere in the documentation.

All papers live authoritatively in the **eb-papers** repository. This section serves as an orientation and navigation layer only.

## Role of papers in Electric Barometer

Electric Barometer distinguishes clearly between:

- **Documentation** — explains concepts and workflows  
- **Guides** — describe how to perform tasks  
- **Metrics and Optimization** — define evaluation and decision logic  
- **Papers** — formally prove, justify, and ground the framework  

Papers exist to make the system **rigorous, defensible, and extensible**. They are not required reading for day-to-day use, but they are essential for validation, review, and long-term integrity.

## Types of papers

The Papers section includes two categories of formal work.

### Technical Notes

**Technical Notes** are focused, component-level documents that define and formalize specific mechanisms within the framework.

They are used to:
- Establish precise definitions
- Make assumptions explicit
- Provide stable, citable references

See **[Technical Notes](technical-notes/)**.

---

### Technical Papers

**Technical Papers** are extended, system-level works that integrate multiple components into cohesive theoretical frameworks.

They are used to:
- Present end-to-end architectures
- Develop theory across layers
- Support executive, architectural, or academic review

See **[Technical Papers](technical-papers/)**.

## How papers relate to the rest of the documentation

Papers do not replace documentation. Instead:

- **Concepts** explain *why* ideas exist  
- **Guides** explain *how* to apply them  
- **Metrics and Optimization** explain *how behavior is measured and resolved*  
- **Papers** explain *why the system is valid*  

This separation ensures clarity while preserving rigor.

## When you should read the papers

You should consult the Papers section when you need to:

- Validate formal definitions or assumptions
- Defend design choices under scrutiny
- Understand theoretical guarantees or constraints
- Support governance, audit, or review
- Extend the framework formally

If your goal is practical usage, start with **[Guides](../guides/)** or **[Concepts](../concepts/)** instead.

---

## Governance and stability

Papers are treated as governed artifacts:

- They are versioned and archived
- Superseded papers remain interpretable
- Documentation links preserve historical context
- Updates are deliberate and reviewable

This ensures that decisions and evaluations remain traceable over time.

## Where to go next

- Browse **[Technical Notes](technical-notes/)** for focused formal definitions  
- Explore **[Technical Papers](technical-papers/)** for system-level theory  
- Return to **[Reference](../reference/)** for authoritative lookup  
- Revisit **[Concepts](../concepts/)** for explanatory context  

Papers are the formal backbone of Electric Barometer. They exist to make the framework credible, auditable, and durable as it evolves.
