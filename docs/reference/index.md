# Reference

The Reference section provides authoritative, lookup-oriented documentation for the Electric Barometer ecosystem. It is intended for readers who already understand the conceptual framework and need precise definitions, structures, or cross-links.

Unlike Guides, which are task-oriented, and Concepts, which explain *why* the system is structured as it is, Reference pages focus on *what exists* and *how it is defined*.

---

## What belongs in Reference

Reference documentation includes:

- Canonical definitions and terminology
- Structural overviews and schemas
- Enumerations of components or layers
- Stable contracts and interfaces
- Cross-cutting lookup material

Reference pages prioritize clarity, completeness, and stability over narrative flow.

---

## What does not belong in Reference

Reference documentation intentionally avoids:

- Step-by-step instructions
  (see **[Guides](../guides/)**)

- Conceptual motivation or philosophy
  (see **[Concepts](../concepts/)**)

- Policy decisions or tradeoff rationale
  (see **[Optimization](../optimization/)**)

- Implementation details or code-level APIs
  (see repository-specific documentation)

---

## Reference sections

The Reference section includes the following areas:

### Glossaries and terminology
- **[Glossary](../concepts/glossary/)** — canonical definitions of core terms used throughout the ecosystem

### Metrics reference
- **[Metrics](../metrics/)** — definitions and interpretation of evaluation metrics
- **[CWSL](../metrics/cwsl/)** — reference documentation for Cost-Weighted Service Loss

### Optimization reference
- **[Optimization](../optimization/)** — policy, tuning, and decision logic structures

### Ecosystem structure
- **[Ecosystem Map](../start/ecosystem-map/)** — how repositories and layers fit together

### Research and formal definitions
- **[Papers](../papers/)** — formal technical notes and theoretical foundations

## How to use the Reference section

Use Reference pages when you need to:

- Confirm the meaning of a term
- Verify assumptions encoded by a metric
- Understand how components relate structurally
- Locate the authoritative definition of a concept
- Cross-reference documentation across sections

Reference pages are designed to be consulted repeatedly, not read linearly.

---

## Stability and governance

Reference documentation is treated as **stable and authoritative**.

Changes to reference material should:

- Be deliberate and reviewed
- Preserve backward interpretability where possible
- Be aligned with released versions of the ecosystem
- Avoid silent or informal updates

This stability supports governance, auditability, and long-term maintainability.

## Where to go next

If you are:

- Looking for *how to do something* → see **[Guides](../guides/)**
- Looking for *why something exists* → see **[Concepts](../concepts/)**
- Looking for *how decisions are made* → see **[Optimization](../optimization/)**
- Looking for *formal theory* → see **[Papers](../papers/)**

The Reference section exists to ground the rest of the documentation in precise, shared understanding.

Electric Barometer documentation is designed to separate explanation, instruction, and reference.
This section is where definitions live.
